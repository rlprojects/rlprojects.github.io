		<center><div><p>Internet Privacy. It’s a thing many people believe they have, but little actually do. So much of today's technology has little hidden services and components running in the background, written in the small fine print of the Terms and Conditions.
Let’s take your phone for example. Use an iPhone? Despite what one of their recent YouTube videos says, they could care less about your privacy. With background services running in the background of IOS, and all of their apps, collecting information on you, your age, your address, your interests, even the way you type. However, Majority of Android users are not safe either, with Android running hidden Google services in the background of the operating system and all of their apps, doing just the same. See how JUST your phone alone spies on you? Oh, my friend, is that just the beginning... Use social media? They do just the same, collecting your data, your location, your interests, and what you like. Use Windows or Mac-OS? Guess what? It does the same! Spotify, and all of your favorite popular music services do it too. Even YouTube, Netflix and Stan do it. Many popular websites collect your information with cookies and JavaScript. The most common email service providers aren't safe from criticisms either, they do these things as well. All this may make me seem super paranoid, but it’s all true.
		</p></div></center>
		
		<br>

		<center><div><p>So, why do they all do this, and how can you stay safe? In this text I will explain all of this, and more.</p></div></center>

		<br>

		<center><div><p>Money, the thing that keeps the world moving. These large companies collect loads of your data, then sell it off to third parties and advertisers, and keep it to themselves so they can advertise their own products to you. You might think they would only make a little bit of money off all this personal information. However, by mass collecting everyone’s data, they make millions.</p></div></center>

		<center><div><p>All of these countries government's use tools to spy on your internet activity and everything you do. So it’s not just the corporations that spy on you, it’s your government too. These countries have agreed to international surveillance alliances, to monitor all of your online activity. This is referred to in the privacy community as "The 14 Eyes." Israel also has also been known to work with the National Security Agency (NSA) In the U.S, and are known as observers to the 14 Eyes.</p></div></center>

		<center><h1>How can you protect yourself?</h1></center>
		<center><div><p>You can use some of the following tools to make your online life more private and secure:</p></div></center>

		<center><div><ul>
		<li>A virtual private network or a VPN, encrypts all of your traffic and routes it through a server.</li>
		<li>The Onion Router, commonly known as Tor and the Tor web browser.</li>
		<p> “The Tor network is a group of volunteer-operated servers that allows people to improve their privacy and security on the Internet. Tor's users employ this network by connecting through a series of virtual tunnels rather than making a direct connection, thus allowing both organizations and individuals to share information over public networks without compromising their privacy. Along the same line, Tor is an effective censorship circumvention tool, allowing it's users to reach otherwise blocked destinations or content. Tor can also be used as a building block for software developers to create new communication tools with built-in privacy features.</li>
		Individuals use Tor to keep websites from tracking them and their family members, or to connect to news sites, instant messaging services, or the like when these are blocked by their local Internet providers. Tor's onion services let users publish web sites and other services without needing to reveal the location of the site. Individuals also use Tor for socially sensitive communication: chat rooms and web forums for rape and abuse survivors, or people with illnesses.”

		<li>Linux distributions. Linux is an operating system that is free, private, and open source. Meaning you can see what goes on behind the scenes and edit it in anyway you want. It is fully private too, as it sends no data. Linux is just the kernel for hundreds of community maintained distributions such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Debian, Arch, Gentoo, Fedora, Void, Manjaro, Solus, CentOS, just to name a few.</li>
		<li>Privacy extensions listed on https://www.privacytools.io/. These prevent trackers and can encrypt your data for extra safety.</li>
		</ul></div></center>

<li>Little to no privacy. You use social media a lot, Windows, Google, and a generic email provider. You have little to no care about privacy, the average joe.</li>
<li>You have dipped your toes into the water. You are somewhat aware of what’s going on, and change your settings a bit to be a little bit more private.</li>
<li>Knees deep. You understand what’s happening, but still enjoy living a convenient life. You use Privacy Tools and extensions, you use Mozilla Firefox and DuckDuckGo instead of Google. You only have 1 or 2 social media accounts, and are willing to delete them at any time.</li>
<li>Linux. You have switched to the private, free, open sourced operating Linux, and use the Tor Web browser, you have no social media accounts. You use Proton Mail or Tutanota.</li>
<li>You use Tails OS or Qubes, and route all of your Network Traffic through the Tor Network. You use multiple different email addresses, each for different things, such as business, family, and any almost required social media, such as LinkedIn for work.</li>
<li>You have created a hardened version of the Gentoo Linux distribution system that’s hand crafted. You follow all the steps of step 5 but go further by turning off the router when you are not using the internet.</li>
<li>Borderline Schizophrenia. You adorn a tinfoil hat, and put tinfoil over all of your technology, you feel constantly paranoid, and think you are always being watched, even in real life. You may even hear voices.</li>
